# 🐍 Python Learning Journey: Core Fundamentals

Welcome to my personal Python learning repository. This space serves as a living laboratory where I document my progress, from basic logic exercises to advanced programming concepts.

My goal is to build a solid foundation in software development and demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning.

## 📈 Methodology
Every script in this repository is handwritten to ensure a deep understanding of the logic and syntax. I focus on:
1. **Code Readability:** Using meaningful variable names (clean code).
2. **Problem Solving:** Breaking down complex tasks into small, functional scripts.
3. **Consistency:** Committing code regularly to track my evolution.
